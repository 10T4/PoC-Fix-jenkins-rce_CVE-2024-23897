<h3>Introduction</h3>

The issue, assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-23897, has been described as an arbitrary file read vulnerability through the built-in command line interface. This command parser has a feature that replaces an @ character followed by a file path in an argument with the file's contents (expandAtFiles). This feature is enabled by default and Jenkins 2.441 and earlier, LTS 2.426.2 and earlier does not disable it.

<h3>PoC</h3>

For this PoC I have downloaded Jenkins with Docker
'''docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:2.426.2'''
